                        <h2>Discovering Mars</h2> 
                        <p>Mars is a red planet located in the outer reaches of our solar system, about 225 million kilometers (142 million miles) from the sun. It's the <b>fourth-largest planet from the sun, and the seventh largest</b>. It's the only planet we know of inhabited entirely by robots.</p>

                       <h2>Namesake</h2>
                       <p>Mars was named by <b>the ancient Romans for their god of war </b>because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. Other civilizations also named the planet for this attribute - for example, <b>the Egyptians called it "Her Desher,"</b> meaning "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.</p>
                       <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
                       <p>Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.</p>

                        <p>Mars has two small moons, <b>Phobos</b> and <b>Deimos</b>, that may be captured asteroids. They're potato-shaped because they have too little mass for gravity to make them spherical.</p>

                            <p>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.</p>

                            <p>Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep.</p>

                            <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
                            <p>Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth. Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets.</p>
                            <p>The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).</p>
                            <p>Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles.</p>
